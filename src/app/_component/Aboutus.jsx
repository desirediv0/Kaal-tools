            My grandfather established this business in the year 1979, he
            started as a trading company catering to the metalworking industry.
            From the very beginning, his focus wasn&#39;t just on transactions;
            it was about truly understanding what his customers needed. It was
            that dedication to excellent products and unwavering service that
            allowed him to build not just a business, but genuine trust and
            lasting customer loyalty. Under his guidance, the company continued
            to grow and evolve, and in 1985, we took the pivotal step of setting
            up our own manufacturing unit, specializing in making Machine Tool
            Accessories.

                Our very first product off the line was a revolving center which
                we made for the US market. A seemingly simple yet crucial tool
                known for its ability to provide stable and accurate support for
                workpieces during machining operations. This early focus on
                fundamental precision laid the groundwork for the high standards
                that KAAL TOOLS continues to uphold today.
